## Real Estate Website

This project is part of my internship at GenZ EducateWing in the domain of frontend development. I created a real estate website using HTML and CSS, showcasing various properties with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. 
This project demonstrates my skills in web design and frontend development, focusing on creating a visually appealing and responsive layout.
